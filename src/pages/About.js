        Airbnb is a platform that connects people who need a place to stay with people who have extra space.
        We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the world, not just those with
        the means to afford traditional, overpriced hotels. Whether youâ€™re traveling for business, pleasure,
        or something in between, Airbnb makes it easy and affordable to find a place to stay anywhere in the world.
